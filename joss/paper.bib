abstract = {A consistent framework for parameter estimation in distributed hydrological catchment modelling using automatic calibration is formulated. The framework focuses on the different steps in the estimation process from model parameterisation and selection of calibration parameters, formulation of calibration criteria,and choice of optimisation algorithm. The calibration problem is formulated in a general multi-objective context in which different objective functions that measure individual process descriptions can be optimised simultaneously. Within this framework it is possible to tailor the model calibration to the specific objectives of the model application being considered. A test example is presented that illustrates the use of the calibration framework for parameter estimation in the MIKE SHE integrated and distributed hydrological modelling system. A significant trade-off between the performance of the groundwater level simulations and the catchment runoff is observed in this case,defining a Pareto front with a very sharp structure. The Pareto optimum solution corresponding to a proposed balanced aggregated objective function is seen to provide a proper balance between the two objectives. Compared to a manual expert calibration,the balanced Pareto optimum solution provides generally better simulation of the runoff, whereas virtually similar performance is obtained for the groundwater level simulations. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Computer models of environmental systems routinely inform decision making for water resource management. In this context, quantifying uncertainty in the important simulated outputs, and reducing uncertainty through assimilating historic system-state observations, is as important as the numerical model. However, implementing high-dimensional and stochastic workflows are challenging, often requiring that practitioners have theoretical and practical understanding of several advanced topics. Worse, implementing these important analyses can take substantial time and effort. This additional effort is often cited as justification for postponing, or even forgoing, these analyses. Herein, we present scripting tools to facilitate the efficient and repeatable construction of high-dimensional, geostatistical-based PEST interfaces, including uncertainty analyses. As demonstrated, these tools can be applied with minimal effort to a model with varied temporal and spatial discretization. Ultimately, these tools can enable low-cost access to valuable decision-support analyses earlier and more frequently during the modeling workflow.},

abstract = {We have developed pyEMU, a python framework for Environmental Modeling Uncertainty analyses, open-source tool that is non-intrusive, easy-to-use, computationally efficient, and scalable to highly-parameterized inverse problems. The framework implements several types of linear (first-order, second-moment (FOSM)) and non-linear uncertainty analyses. The FOSM-based analyses can also be completed prior to parameter estimation to help inform important modeling decisions, such as parameterization and objective function formulation. Complete workflows for several types of FOSM-based and non-linear analyses are documented in example notebooks implemented using Jupyter that are available in the online pyEMU repository. Example workflows include basic parameter and forecast analyses, data worth analyses, and error-variance analyses, as well as usage of parameter ensemble generation and management capabilities. These workflows document the necessary steps and provides insights into the results, with the goal of educating users not only in how to apply pyEMU, but also in the underlying theory of applied uncertainty quantification.},
