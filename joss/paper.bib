abstract = {Computer models of environmental systems routinely inform decision making for water resource management. In this context, quantifying uncertainty in the important simulated outputs, and reducing uncertainty through assimilating historic system-state observations, is as important as the numerical model. However, implementing high-dimensional and stochastic workflows are challenging, often requiring that practitioners have theoretical and practical understanding of several advanced topics. Worse, implementing these important analyses can take substantial time and effort. This additional effort is often cited as justification for postponing, or even forgoing, these analyses. Herein, we present scripting tools to facilitate the efficient and repeatable construction of high-dimensional, geostatistical-based PEST interfaces, including uncertainty analyses. As demonstrated, these tools can be applied with minimal effort to a model with varied temporal and spatial discretization. Ultimately, these tools can enable low-cost access to valuable decision-support analyses earlier and more frequently during the modeling workflow.},

@article{Madsen2003,
abstract = {A consistent framework for parameter estimation in distributed hydrological catchment modelling using automatic calibration is formulated. The framework focuses on the different steps in the estimation process from model parameterisation and selection of calibration parameters, formulation of calibration criteria,and choice of optimisation algorithm. The calibration problem is formulated in a general multi-objective context in which different objective functions that measure individual process descriptions can be optimised simultaneously. Within this framework it is possible to tailor the model calibration to the specific objectives of the model application being considered. A test example is presented that illustrates the use of the calibration framework for parameter estimation in the MIKE SHE integrated and distributed hydrological modelling system. A significant trade-off between the performance of the groundwater level simulations and the catchment runoff is observed in this case,defining a Pareto front with a very sharp structure. The Pareto optimum solution corresponding to a proposed balanced aggregated objective function is seen to provide a proper balance between the two objectives. Compared to a manual expert calibration,the balanced Pareto optimum solution provides generally better simulation of the runoff, whereas virtually similar performance is obtained for the groundwater level simulations. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
